I build visual parts. not increment functionality.
some parts that I could not figure out how to use I would like to have your advice.
Also, I named files that I was assigned to create components as the document mentioned.


＊when you want to see the 06 Service Requests 02 Service Requests Overview(empty)<br>
change the value of "useState()" in containers/Request.tsx<br>
like so <br>
`const [hasRequest, setHasRequest] = useState(false);`

Somehow the functionality not working when I but the "select" and "textarea" from Rex.
It seems working fine when I put each of them...

I could not change the color of the arrow and selected option in the "select".
Also, the border-line color of the "textarea" when it is hovered.

## icons
I try to implement it from Rex. I could not understand how to change the icons....I only see the shop icon.

## logo
